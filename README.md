Some good things about this design is that it includes all of the necessary buttons for the building. It has a button for each of the four floors, as well as open, close and alarm. There is even a button to call for help. The button lights up when it is pressed so that the user knows it is working. It may be better to space the floor buttons out more so it is more clear which button is for which floor. Another way to improve this design is connect the numbers and symbols to the button so that it is clear which number goes to which button.

Common uses of an elevator:
  Moving up a large building that would take too long using stairs
  Moving large or heavy objects to other floors in the building
  Disabled persons moving up or down a building.
  
This elevator design makes doing these things easier, because it is easy to understand how it works based on the layout.
The user pushes a button, then the elevator opens. Once inside, the user can push the button corresponding to the floor they need. The elevator takes them to that floor.
The elevator has numbers or symbols next to the buttons so the user knows what button does what.
The floor button will glow red once it is pushed to let the user know it has been pushed.
It is possible for someone to mistake the button for another one because the numbers are not connected to the button.
